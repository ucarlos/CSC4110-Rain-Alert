* CSC 4110 Project -- Rain Detector using a Raspberry Pi
This repository contains all the files needed to use a Raspberry Pi as a Rain Detector, which reports changes in local rain levels to a email server, as well as other options.
This project was led by Ulysses Carlos (myself) and Jared Goldman.
** Project Timeline

** Necessary Hardware
This project required the following hardware in order to work:
- Rain Sensor
- Float Sensor
- Graduated Cylinder 
** Necessary Software
Since this is a CLion Project, you can try installing it on your system and opening it, making sure to have the following components installed on your system. CLion comes with a version of CMake, but you may need to install the following:

**** PostgreSQL with libpq and libpqxx >= 6
You can install all three on an Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian using the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev libpqxx-dev
#+END_SRC

If on macOS, you can install the packages using homebrew:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
brew install postgresql
brew install libpq
brew install libpqxx
#+END_SRC
**** CMake >= 3.15 (If CLion cannot be installed on your system)
If on Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian, use the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
#+END_SRC
On other Linux or UNIX Systems, you may need to use your package manager or [[https://cmake.org/download/][compile from source.]] You may also have to compile from source if your CMake version is less than 3.15.

** Explanation 
** How to compile
If you can get CLion running on your machine, simply execute the program by pressing the run button on the top right (SHIFT-F10). If you can't get CLion (Or decide not to), run the following command in the project directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" .
make

#+END_SRC

** Example Usage
To run the program, do
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./CSC4110_Project
#+END_SRC

- I used this [[https://github.com/somnisoft/smtp-client][SMTP Library for the project.]]
